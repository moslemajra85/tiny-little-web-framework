# Tiny Client Side Web Framework
This is a tiny little framework that reimplements some of the features exposed by the widely used \
frontend web framework (`React.js, Angular View.js etc...`).
It is just for learning purposes and it is not mean to be a fully flushed framewok.

__Inspiration__: `Stephen Grider`'s  Typescript course on Udemy.
